					OUR KINDERGARTEN
				</h3>
			
				<p>
					During kindergarten education, we prepare children for primary school. 
					We teach them sharing, solidarity, socializing and working together. 
					The aim of preschool education is to arouse interest in learning in children and 
					to make the existing abilities of the child visible. We also work for this purpose. 
					During this period, we try to teach children as much as possible, as they have high 
					learning potential. We raise them in good physical conditions and an active social environment. 
					This way, they can become the future Einstein.

				<h3>
					OUR PRIMARY SCHOOL
				</h3>
			
				<p>
					In our primary school, we encourage our students to take responsibility for their learning, 
					to take responsibility for their behavior, to protect nature and to serve society. 
					We expect them to initiate meaningful and responsible actions as a result of their learning. 
					Participation in community service activities gives our students the skills of collaboration, 
					problem solving, conflict resolution, creative and critical thinking. 
					Accordingly, we include them in community service activities. As Demer Primary School, 
					we offer a learning environment without the time, place, age and limits of learning.

					can think critically and multidimensionally, have effective communication skills, 
					and are creative and inclined to teamwork. We train our students to be self-confident, 
					able to think freely, and success-oriented individuals, who form the basis of our education
